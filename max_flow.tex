Current fastest algorithm $O(n^{3/2})$(Lee Sidford '14)\\
\textbf{Our focus}: Sparse graph $(m=O(n))$ and unit-capacity(U=1) regime.
Find $(1-\epsilon)$-approx. $O(n^{4/3}\epsilon^{-3})$-time algorithm.

\subsection{Finding electrical flows}
Let $L$ be the laplacian for graph $G(V,E)$ where edge $e$ has weight $\frac{1}{R_e }$.  The potential vector $\phi$ for the electric flow and the current vector $i$ whose j-th
component is the outgoing current at vertex $j$ are related as follows,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    L\phi=i \\
    L^+i=\phi
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The Laplacian linear system solver can be used to find the electrical flow for any $i$ in time $O(m)$ by finding $\phi$ and then the current through each edge using Ohm's law.

\subsection{Algorithm for max flow}
\textbf{Binary search:} Suppose we have an algorithm that constructs a flow of value $f$ if one exists. The value of the max flow $F^*$ can be found in $\log n$ iterations by binary search and the max flow can be found by running the algorithm with input $F^*$.
\begin{algorithm}[H]

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE $LB=0$,$UB=n^2$

\WHILE{$UB-LB>\epsilon$}
    \STATE  $F^*=\frac{UB+LB}{2}$
    \STATE run the algorithm for $F^*$
    \IF{exist flow}
        \STATE $LB=F^*$
    \ELSE
        \STATE $UB=F^*$
     \ENDIF
\ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

    \STATE $\rho_i=\max_e|f^i(e)|$
    \STATE $\rho=\max(\rho,\rho_i)$
    \FOR{$e \in E$}
        \IF{$f^i(e)>O(n^{1/3})$}
            \STATE remove $e$
        \ELSE
            \STATE $r^i_e=r_e^{i-1}(1+\epsilon|f^i(e)|\rho^{-1}_i)$
            \STATE $i=i+1$
        \ENDIF

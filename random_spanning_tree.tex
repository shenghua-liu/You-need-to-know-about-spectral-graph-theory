\section{Random Spanning Tree}
\subsection{Define}
Let $G(V, E)$ be a finite graph and $n = |V|$. The following three conditions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
    \item G is a tree.
    \item G is circuit-free and has $n-1$ edges.
    \item G is connected and has $n-1$ edges.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Count trees}
Let us define \textbf{in-degree matrix D} of a digraph $G(V, E)$, where $V=\{1, 2, \cdots, n\}$, as follows:
\[
    D(i, j)=\begin{cases}d_{in}(i) & if\ i=j \\ -k& if \ i \neq j, where\ k \ is \ the \ number \ of \ edges \ from \ i \ to \ j. \end{cases}
\]
\begin{theorem}
The number of directed spanning trees with root $r$ of a digraph the minor of its \emph{in-degree matrix} which results from the erasure of the $r$th row and column.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Random Spanning Tree}
All the directed spanning trees of $G_M$ rooted at $i$ is denoted $T_{i}(G_M)$ and all rooted directed spanning trees of $G_M$ denoted $T(G_M)$.
\begin{theorem}[Markov chain tree theorem]
Let $M$ be an irreducible Markov chain on $n$ states with stationary distribution $\pi_1, \cdots, \pi_n$. Let $G_M$ be the directed graph associated with $M$. Then
\begin{equation}
    \pi_{i} = \frac{\sum_{T \in \mathcal{T}_i(G_M)}w(T)}{\sum_{T \in \mathcal{T}(G_M)}w(T)}, w(T) = \prod_{e \in T}{w(e)}.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
